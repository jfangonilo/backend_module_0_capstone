## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a fork in the code that continues down a specified
path when certain conditions are met. There's if-statements, unless-statements
and case-statements. These conditions are checked through logical operators
such as  >, <, <=, >=, ==, ||, &&, etc

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
When you need to make a decision on how to proceed based on conditions

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if (certain condition)
  (do this)
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You can use else if and else

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
if (condition A)
 (do this)
elsif (condition B)
 (do this instead)
else
  (do this other thing)

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
Unless-statements and case-statements can make code more readable, depending on
the conditions.
